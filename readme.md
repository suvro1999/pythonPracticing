Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.<br>
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.<br>

<h2 style="margin-top:10 px, color:#f9322c,text-aline:center">Why Python?</h2>
Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).<br>
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.<br>
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.<br>
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.<br>
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.<br>
